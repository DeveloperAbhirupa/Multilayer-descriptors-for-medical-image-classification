# Multilayer-descriptors-for-medical-image-classification
Developing a method for improving the performance of 2D descriptors by building an n-layer image using different preprocessing approaches from which multilayer descriptors are extracted and used as feature vectors for training a Support Vector Machine. The different preprocessing approaches are used to build different n-layer images (n 1⁄43, n 1⁄45, etc.). We test both color and gray-level images, two well-known texture descriptors (Local Phase Quantization and Local Binary Pattern), and three of their variants suited for n-layer images (Volume Local Phase Quantization, Local Phase Quan- tization Three-Orthogonal-Planes, and Volume Local Binary Patterns).
